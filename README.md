# sorting_algorithms

There are two files:
sorting.py contains sorting functions implementing algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, insert sort, bucket sort and heap sort

sorting_graphs.py draws graph for algorithm of choice, where on x axis there is length of an array that is being sorted (each array of length n contains n random numbers between 1 and 100) and on y axis is average time needed to sort the array of said length (average is counted based on time it took to sort 10 generated arrays of one length). You can also choose option "compare" - you are then asked to choose 2 algorithms, they are both "drawn" on one graph where you can easily compare their efficiency.
